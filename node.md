# Node and NPM

  Lots of stuff requires Node (editor plugins, Angular4, etc.), so let's go ahead and get that out of the way.

  - Install Node with Brew: `brew install node`, or go here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> and download the Mac installer. Click the installer and follow the instructions.
  
  - NPM (Node Package Manager) helps you install and manage applications which rely on Node. It will be installed automatically along with Node.
