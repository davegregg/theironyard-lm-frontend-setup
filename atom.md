# [Atom and the Atom Package Manager](./atom.md)

We're going to be using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor for a portion of the cohort. So, let's install it.

- Go to https://atom.io/ and download the installer. Follow Mac's usual process for installing packages.

In the next step we're going to add packages to Atom from the Terminal, so here's how to install the CLI (command-line interface) helpers for Atom:

- Run `which apm` in your Terminal. If it returns a file path, then Atom and its package manager are already installed on your command-line correctly. If it says instead, "apm not found" (or returns nothing), then open Atom the traditional way, find "Install Shell Scripts" in the Atom menu, and click it. Close your Terminal and re-open it.
