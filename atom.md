# Atom and APM (Atom Package Manager)

We're going to be using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor for a portion of the cohort. So, let's install it.

- `brew cask install atom`

- APM will help you install and manage Atom plugins (packages) via the command-line. 
    - Run `which apm` in your Terminal. If it returns a file path, then Atom and its package manager are already installed on your command-line correctly. If it says instead, "apm not found" (or returns nothing), then open Atom, find "Install Shell Scripts" in the Atom menu, and click it. Close your Terminal and re-open it. `apm` should now be available in your terminal.
