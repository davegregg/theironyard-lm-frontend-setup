### Tweaking Atom

One of the things that makes Atom powerful is its package system. I've curated a list a recommended packages that will make your life easier over the coming weeks. *Run this in Terminal:*

`apm stars --user davegregg --install`

Packages this will install:

- [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
    - Beautify HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Coldfusion, SQL, and more in Atom

- [linter-htmlhint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-htmlhint)
    - Helps correct and clean up HTML documents by fixing markup errors and upgrading legacy code to modern standards.

    - **Before we can use this, we'll need to run `npm install htmlhint --global`.**
- [linter-scss-lint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-scss-lint)
    - Helps you correct errors in your SCSS.

    - **Before we can use this, we'll need to run `gem install scss_lint`.**
    
- [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
    - Helps you correct errors and some bad practices in your JavaScript.
    
    - **Before we can use this, we'll need to run `npm install eslint --global`.**

- [livereload](https://atom.io/packages/livereload)
    - Watches for changes in files and automatically reloads the associated browser page.

    - **Before we can use this, we need to install the [LiveReload extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).**
    - After installing this extension, in Chrome, navigate to `Tools` > `Extensions` > `LiveReload` and enable the "Allow access to file URLs" checkbox.
    - Look in the status bar at the very bottom of the Atom window. You will see "LiveReload: Off". We need to turn it on. So, navigate to `Packages` > `LiveReload` > `Toggle Server`. The status will change to "LiveReload: XXXXX" (where XXXXX will be a port number). Click the status to copy a link to the LiveReload JavaScript file to your clipboard. Use that link in a script tag at the bottom of any HTML file you want to refresh automatically.
- [atom-wrap-in-tag](https://atom.io/packages/atom-wrap-in-tag)
    - Select text you want to wrap in an HTML tag, and hit Alt + Shift + w. Then type the name of tag ('div', 'script', etc.), and both the opening and closing HTML tags will be created for you.

- [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html)
    - Automatically adds closing tags when you complete the opening tag.

- [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker)
    - Right-click somewhere you need some code to represent a color. Select Color Picker and pick a color you like. Hit Enter and you're done.

- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
    - Displays the color of a color code as the background color behind the color code itself, so you can see the color at a glance.

- [rainbow-delimiters](https://atom.io/packages/rainbow-delimiters)
    - Highlights matching pairs of parentheses, brackets, and braces on either side of your cursor. Each pair has its own color so you can more-easily tell which matches which!

- [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)
    - Provides a visual overview of a file's full source code, for ease of moving about in long files.

- [minimap-highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-highlight-selected)
    - Highlights all occurrences of a selected word.

- [todo-show](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show)
    - TODO-show reveals comments scattered through your project containing keywords such as TODO, IDEA, NOTE, CHANGED (and others). Use one of those keywords and TODO-show will keep track of each one and where you put it.

- [auto-detect-indentation](https://atom.io/packages/auto-detect-indentation)
    - Automatically detects and configures default indentation for each file.

- [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)
    - Provides tools for automating repetitive HTML tasks. You'll want to ignore this for now until you have grown comfortable with both HTML and CSS (see https://emmet.io/).

- [rest-client](https://atom.io/packages/rest-client)
    - Lightweight REST client for testing APIs. You'll can use this later in the course.

- And a few dependencies necessary for the above plugins to use: [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter), [linter-ui-default](https://atom.io/packages/linter-ui-default), [intentions](https://atom.io/packages/intentions), and [busy-signal](https://atom.io/packages/busy-signal).

Review the linked documentation for those when you get a chance to discover more about how they're used and how you can tweak them for your projects.

Also:

 - If you don't see line numbers of the left side of your files, use Cmd-Shift-P to open the Command Palette. Type "line numbers" and hit Enter to toggle the "Show Line Numbers" setting to enabled.
 - Hit Cmd-Comma on your keyboard to open Preferences, navigate to Packages, type "autosave" in the text box at the top. Click Settings and put a checkmark next to Enabled.

### Set up Git to use Atom for long commit messages

- Run `git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`

# Other Mac niceties

Since many of you are also new to the Mac, I wanted to throw in some other helpful Mac tips.

None of these are _required_, but they're nice-to-haves.

* **An app launcher:** Hunting around your Mac for a particular application to open gets tedious fast. You can use the built-in Spotlight (typically available via `âŒ˜-Space`). Or you can use a purpose-built app launcher like [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com). In general, I find specific app launchers like Alfred (generally available via `Command-Space`) a bit snappier and they tend to have additional features that you might find handy.
* **A password manager:** You're going to have a ton of passwords floating around and the typical options - one password for them all, or trying to remember them all - are both _horribly_ unsafe. Password managers such as [KeePass](http://keepass.info/download.html) (locally-installed only, so you'll have to backup your password database yourself), [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) (recommended, but pricey - $35-$50), [Dashlane](http://lp.dashlane.com/cjv2/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=US_Search_Brand_Exact&utm_medium=15594053097&utm_term=dashlane&gclid=CPWqiLWyl8YCFQYuaQodm0MA1g), or [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) will make your life _significantly_ better and much more secure.
* **A better Terminal:** The default Terminal application on your Mac is _fine_, really. But if you want to take it a step further, I can highly recommend [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com). Bonus: It's _free_. Note: Download the test release (iTerm2 3.0.10 beta (OS 10.8+))
