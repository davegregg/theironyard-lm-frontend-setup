# Other Mac niceties

Since many of you are also new to the Mac, I wanted to throw in some other helpful Mac tips.

None of these are _required_, but they're nice-to-haves.

* **An app launcher:** Hunting around your Mac for a particular application to open gets tedious fast. You can use the built-in Spotlight (typically available via `âŒ˜-Space`). Or you can use a purpose-built app launcher like [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com). In general, I find specific app launchers like Alfred (generally available via `Command-Space`) a bit snappier and they tend to have additional features that you might find handy.

* **A password manager:** You're going to have a ton of passwords floating around and the typical options - one password for them all, or trying to remember them all - are both _horribly_ unsafe. Password managers such as [KeePass](http://keepass.info/download.html) (locally-installed only, so you'll have to backup your password database yourself), [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) (recommended, but pricey - $35-$50), [Dashlane](http://lp.dashlane.com/cjv2/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=US_Search_Brand_Exact&utm_medium=15594053097&utm_term=dashlane&gclid=CPWqiLWyl8YCFQYuaQodm0MA1g), or [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) will make your life _significantly_ better and much more secure.

* **A better Terminal:** The default Terminal application on your Mac is _fine_, really. But if you want to take it a step further, I can highly recommend [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com). Bonus: It's _free_. Note: Download the test release (iTerm2 3.0.10 beta (OS 10.8+))
